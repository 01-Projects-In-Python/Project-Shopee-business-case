## Project overview:

__Introduction:__

In response to the challenge faced by online businesses like Shopee, the task is to identify near-duplicate products within a large dataset. This task becomes more complex due to the diverse user-generated content, including images and product descriptions. The goal of this project is to develop a machine-learning model that can accurately identify products that have been posted repeatedly, even when they may have subtle differences in images, titles, or descriptions.
